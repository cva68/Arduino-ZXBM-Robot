# Arduino Robot Control Code
Software to control an Arduino robot, making use of a custom shield based on the [ZXBM5210 motor driver](https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/products_inactive_data/ZXBM5210.pdf), and a chassis to hold two ["TT" geared DC motors](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3777). 

The Arduino shield design can be found in [hw](hw), and the robot chassis design can be found in [chassis](/chassis). Modules for interfacing with the shield can be found in [lib](/lib), and example control code is in [src](/src).
