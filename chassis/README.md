# Chassis
This chassis is specifically designed for the **Univeristy of Canterbury** Arduino Uno clone. The mount positions will need to be modified to be used with a standard Arduino Uno.

This is designed for 3D printing. Support will only be needed for the overhangs on the top of the chassis that are used to support the Arduino.
